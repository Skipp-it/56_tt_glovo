To make the cookies, put the butter, sugars, treacle, egg and vanilla in a large bowl and mix together with an electric whisk until smooth and combined. In a separate bowl, mix together the remaining ingredients except the demerara. Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture and mix until a very sticky dough is formed. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 4 hrs.

STEP 2
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking trays with baking parchment. Roll the cookie dough into balls, about a tablespoon in size, then roll in the demerara sugar. Place on the lined trays, leaving about 2.5cm space between cookies.

STEP 3
Bake for about 14 mins or until just lightly browned around the edges, swapping the trays over halfway through cooking. Allow to cool on the trays for 10 mins before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

STEP 4
To make the filling, beat together the mascarpone and lemon curd in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a plain round piping tip. Pipe a layer of the cream onto the base of half the cookies and sandwich together with the other half. Will keep for 3-4 days in a sealed container in the fridge – the texture will turn soft and cakey (this is no bad thing).', 'https://images-team-delivery.s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ginger-cookie-sandwiches-with-lemon-mascarpone_0-5a57429.webp', 'Ginger cookie sandwiches with lemon mascarpone', 1);

Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Cut the aubergine lengthways into long thin slices – once you have six slices, chop the remainder. Brush the slices very lightly with oil, place on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment and cook for 15 mins, turning once, until softened and pliable. Turn oven down to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

STEP 2
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and fry the onions until softened. Stir in the chopped aubergine, the peppers, courgettes and garlic, and cook, stirring, for a few mins more. Tip in the tomatoes and a half a can of water, then stir in the bouillon, thyme and basil stalks. Cover and simmer for 20 mins or until tender. You can add up to half a can of water if the mixture is getting too dry. Stir through the basil leaves.

STEP 3
If you are following our Healthy Diet Plan, set aside half of the ratatouille when it is ready - you''ll need to chill this for our ratatouille pasta salad with rocket later in the week. If you''re not following the plan, you can serve the extra ratatouille on the side or set it aside to enjoy for another meal.

STEP 4
Beat the eggs with the yogurt, cheese and 1 tbsp water. Spoon the remaining ratatouille into a shallow ovenproof dish, top with the aubergine slices, then cover with the yogurt mixture and scatter with thyme. Bake for 10-15 mins until the topping is set and starting to colour. Serve with dressed rocket on the side.', 'https://images-team-delivery.s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ratatouille-parmesan-bake-5e302e3.webp', 'atatouille & parmesan bake', 1);

Pour the cream into a large sauté pan with a lid. Stir in the ginger and spices, then submerge the smoked haddock fillets, skin-side up. Put the lid on, bring the cream slowly to the boil, then remove from the heat and leave to cool. Flake the fish into a bowl in large pieces, discarding the skin.

STEP 2
Put the spiced cream back on a medium heat. Once warm, add the cooked rice and peas and stir through to combine. Cook for 3 mins until everything is heated through.

STEP 3
Gently mix in the haddock, being careful to keep it in large flakes. Cook for a further 2 mins and check the seasoning - the smoked haddock will be quite salty, but a good grind of black pepper could be welcome.

To prepare the chicken, tip the coconut milk into a jug and stir in the garlic, spices and 1 tsp salt. Put the chicken in a plastic container or roasting tin and pour over the brine mix to cover. Cover with cling film and chill for 24 hrs.

STEP 2
For the hoppers, put the rice flour in a large bowl. In a jug, combine 125ml water with the yeast and sugar, and leave for about 8 mins until you see some foaming. Pour in the coconut milk and whisk the wet ingredients into the rice flour to make a smooth batter, slightly thinner than pancake batter. Season, cover and allow to ferment overnight in the fridge.

STEP 3
To make the kiri hodi, put all the ingredients (except the coconut milk, lime juice and spinach) in a heavy-based saucepan. Add 1 tbsp water and simmer over a low heat for 5 mins or until the onion softens. Pour in the coconut milk and cook for a further 1-2 mins (do not boil). Tip in the spinach, stir until wilted, then remove from the heat. Season to taste with salt and add the lime juice.

STEP 4
To make the sambol, use a pestle and mortar or mini processor to grind the onions with the chillies, a big pinch of salt and smoked paprika, to form a coarse paste. Season with lime juice and more salt, if needed.

STEP 5
To cook, remove the chicken and hoppers mix from the fridge for about 1 hr so they come to room temperature. To cook the chicken, heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or saucepan until it reaches 180C on a cooking thermometer. To make the fried chicken coating, combine all the ingredients with 1/4 tsp salt in a bowl. Piece by piece, remove the chicken from its brine, allow the excess to drip off, then dredge it in the coating. Shake off the excess and fry in the oil for 6-8 mins until cooked through. Drain on kitchen paper, then rest in a low oven while you make the hoppers.

STEP 6
Make the hoppers. Whisk your hoppers base to remove any lumps. Add a splash more water to thin it if needed. Heat a non-stick frying pan, a hopper pan or small high-sided wok and brush on some rapeseed oil with kitchen paper. Add a ladle of mix to the pan and immediately swirl it around and up the edges to create a bowl-shaped pancake. Cook for 1 min, then add an egg and cover with a lid. Cook for 2-3 mins more until the egg is cooked and the edges are starting to brown. Repeat with the remaining batter and eggs. Serve the hoppers with the chicken, sambol and kiri hodi.', 'https://images-team-delivery.s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/sir-lankan-fried-chicken-hoppers-938e9c2.webp', 'Sri Lankan fried chicken & hoppers', 2);
